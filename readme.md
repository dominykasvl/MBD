This Master's thesis examines log data aggregation and correlation methods, aiming to enhance IT infrastructure security in response to the growing number of cyber incidents. Various log entry aggregation, normalization, and correlation methods are analyzed. A modular system, implemented in the Python programming language, is proposed, which allows for the flexible combination of these methods. The system was tested using the publicly available "Comprehensive, Multi-Source Cyber-Security Events Dataset from LANL" and data collected in a virtual environment created with the GNS3 tool. During testing, correlation was calculated between various types of entries: DNS, network traffic data, process logs, and authentication logs. Various attacks were also simulated in the virtual environment, during which correlation was investigated between IIS server, firewall, VSFTPD, SSHD service, system, and other audit log entries. The obtained results show that with proper algorithm configuration, the method is capable of effectively detecting anomalies and malicious activity.
